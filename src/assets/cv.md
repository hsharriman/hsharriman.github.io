_Graduate Researcher; member of [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/) group and the [Data Interaction Group](https://dig.cmu.edu)_  
_Advisors_: [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/), [Dominik Moritz](https://www.domoritz.de/)  
Building interactive visual tools to provide automatic and intelligent support for student learning of high-school geometric proof.

#### **[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), Palo Alto, CA** `Jan, 2022 - August, 2023`

_Full Stack Engineer; Collections, Teapot teams_  
Built, improved UI for various customer-facing features within Tableau and Salesforce. Wrote APIs for use by Tableau and external developers.

#### **[Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu), Pittsburgh, PA** `Summer, 2021`

_Research Intern; worked on [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/)_  
Contributed to open source research project, Penrose, to generate diagrammatic high school geometry problems from a text prompt using program mutation.

#### **[Tesla Motors](https://www.tesla.com/), Palo Alto, CA** `Fall, 2020`

_Vehicle Software Engineering Intern; Engfleet Tools Team_  
Created robust data collection, cleaning, storage, analysis, and visualization pipeline that processes 2TB raw data/day from the R&D Tesla vehicle fleet. Built an internal dashboard to visualize the CAN data. The dashboard was used to help firmware leadership identify CAN bus message trends and regressions.

#### **[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), Palo Alto, CA** `Summer, 2020`

_Fullstack Software Engineering Intern; Publishing Team_

## Project Experience

#### **[Ender](https://www.hwei-shin.com/#/enderProject)** `2024-present`

Building interactive visualizations of two-column, high-school geometry proofs using Typescript/React. Ender annotates geometric proof to highlight key information at each step and is designed to facilitate proof comprehension.

#### **[Data Analysis of Air Quality in Boston](https://www.hwei-shin.com/#/airpartners)** `2021`

Analyzed the concentrations of dangerous ultrafine particles (UFPs) near roadways and the Logan International Airport using Python, using raw data pulled from special UFP sensors on an hourly basis. The data was used by an air quality app that notified users of the current risk of exposure to UFPs in their area. The results from these tools have been used to raise awareness and inform policy enactments championing cleaner air in underprivileged communities.

#### **[Swiss Poster Generator](https://www.hwei-shin.com/#/swiss)** `2020`

Built an online generator using HTML/CSS/JS that automatically applies design rules to generate custom posters in the Swiss Modernism style.

#### **Stepping with Kinect** `2019`

Built an interactive experience MVP using Unity and a Kinect that detected when a player correctly followed moves in the [Stepping](https://youtu.be/8xQYr6P_qBc?si=Ie6VgH2MDcs9z5h0) dance style. Facial expressions are an important part of stepping, so the game also visually reflected the identified sentiment of the dancer. Project was funded by Microsoft and designed to be installed at Microsoft storefronts.
