I am a 3rd year PhD student in the [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/) and [Dominik Moritz](https://www.domoritz.de/) and a member of the [Data Interaction Group](https://dig.cmu.edu/) and [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/) groups. I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program Recipient and an ARCS Scholar.

My research combines aspects of visualization, human-computer interaction, software engineering, and STEM education. I develop interactive visual aids that help students learn, with a current focus on tools for high school geometric proof. My work also investigates how domain-specific, AI-driven learning environments can provide reliable, adaptive support, and how interactive visualizations can be systematically designed to improve reasoning and learning outcomes.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a fullstack software engineer for Tableau and Tesla Motors, and received my BS in Engineering with concentrations in computing and design from Olin College of Engineering.

Outside of research, I enjoy ballet, making art, and playing video games.
