      "To understand even a modest geometric proof, students must process an interwoven combination of symbolic, diagrammatic, geometric, and logical information. This amount of information density presents a daunting management task that students are known to perform poorly on. To address this challenge, we propose a two-column proof interface that structures the information management task according to diagram configuration schemas. We evaluated our design by comparing secondary school students' performance on proof comprehension tasks with DCS augmentation to using a typical two-column proof. Students using the DCS-augmented interface demonstrated improved overall reasoning and accuracy in geometric proof tasks compared to the traditional two-column format. They were also significantly better at identifying and correcting mistakes in proofs. These results suggest that managing complex information by integrating it in a coherent schema\u2014like DCS\u2014can support student understanding of proof.",

The red bolding indicates that the interior angles necessary for SAS are not known to be congruent by step 4. Adding a reflexive step BD = BD would correct this proof.

      "Making visually appealing and meaningful diagrams involves craftsmanship in designing the visual representation, drawing shapes, and laying them out. Can the effort spent on diagrams by an expert be reused by others, especially those without the expertise in design and drawing? In this paper, we outline our prior work on Penrose, a diagramming tool with first-class support for reusing visual representations. The nature of our approach to reusability necessitates a domain-agnostic method to automatically lay out a diagram. We highlight our existing approach for general diagram layout and styling, and propose a new composable approach for codifying visual representations to reuse expertise that cuts across domains.",

      "Visual thinking with diagrams is a crucial skill for learning and problem-solving in STEM subjects. To improve in this area, students need a variety of visual problems for deliberate practice. However, in our interviews, educators shared that they struggle to create these practice exercises because of limitations of existing tools. We introduce Edgeworth, a tool designed to help educators easily create visual problems. Edgeworth works in two main ways: firstly, it takes a single diagram from the user and systematically alters it to produce many variations, which the educator can then choose from to create multiple problems. Secondly, it automates the layout of diagrams, ensuring consistent high quality without the need for manual adjustments. To assess Edgeworth, we carried out case studies, a technical evaluation, and expert walkthrough demonstrations. We show that Edgeworth can create problems in three domains: geometry, chemistry, and discrete math. These problems were authored in just 15 lines of Edgeworth code on average. Edgeworth generated usable answer options within the first 10 diagram variations in 87% of authored problems. Finally, educators gave positive feedback on Edgeworth’s utility and the real-world applicability of its outputs.",

      "Certified orientation and mobility specialists (COMS) work with clients who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) to help them travel independently with confidence. Part of this process involves creating a narrative description of a route and using specific techniques to help the client internalize it. We focus on the problem of automatically generating a narrative description of an indoor route based on a recording from a smartphone.  These automatically generated narrations could be used in cases where a COMS is not available or to enable clients to independently practice routes that were originally learned with the help of a COMS. Specifically, we introduce Clew3D, a mobile app that leverages LIDAR-equipped iOS devices to identify orientation and mobility (O&M) landmarks and their relative location along a recorded route. The identified landmarks are then used to provide a spoken narration modeled after traditional O&M techniques. Our solution is co-designed with COMS and uses methods and language that they employ when creating route narrations for their clients. In addition to presenting Clew3D, we report the results of an analysis conducted with COMS regarding techniques and terminology used in traditional, in-person O&M instruction.  We also discuss challenges posed by vision-based systems to achieve automatic narrations that are reliable. Finally, we provide an example of an automatically generated route description and compare it with the same route provided by a COMS.",
