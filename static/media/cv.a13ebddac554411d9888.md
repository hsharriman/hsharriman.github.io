_Advisors_: [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/), [Dominik Moritz](https://www.domoritz.de/)  
Building interactive visual tools to provide automatic and intelligent support for student learning of high-school geometric proof.

#### **[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), Palo Alto, CA** `Jan, 2022 - August, 2023`

_Full Stack Engineer; Collections, Teapot teams_  
Built, improved UI for various customer-facing features within Tableau and Salesforce. Wrote APIs for use by Tableau and external developers. _(Typescript, React, Java, C++)_

#### **[Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu), Pittsburgh, PA** `May, 2021 - August, 2021`

_Research Intern; worked on [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/)_

## Project Experience

#### **[Ender](https://www.hwei-shin.com/#/enderProject)** `2024 - present`

Developing interactive visualizations of two-column, high-school geometry proofs. Ender annotates geometric proof to highlight key information at each step and is designed to facilitate proof comprehension. _(Typescript, React, Tailwind)_

#### **[Data Analysis of Air Quality in Boston](https://www.hwei-shin.com/#/airpartners)** `2021`

Developed a pipeline that processed hourly sensor data and analyzed the concentration of dangerous ultrafine particles (UFPs) near roadways and the Logan International Airport. The data was used in an app that notified users of the current risk of exposure to UFPs in their area. It was also used to inform policy enactments championing cleaner air for local communities. _(Python, Airflow)_

#### **[Swiss Poster Generator](https://www.hwei-shin.com/#/swiss)** `2020`

Built an online generator that automatically applies design rules to generate custom posters in the Swiss Modernism style. _(HTML, CSS, JS)_

#### **Stepping with Kinect** `2019`

Built an interactive experience MVP using a Kinect that detected when a player correctly followed moves in the [Stepping](https://youtu.be/8xQYr6P_qBc?si=Ie6VgH2MDcs9z5h0) dance style. Facial expressions are an important part of stepping, so the game also visually reflected the identified sentiment of the dancer. Project was funded by Microsoft and designed to be installed at Microsoft storefronts. _(C#, Unity)_
